# CNN Implementation Project

A convolutional neural network implementation from scratch for image classification using PyTorch.

## Project Description

This project implements a CNN model for classifying images from the MNIST/CIFAR-10 dataset. The implementation focuses on understanding the fundamentals of convolutional neural networks, including:

- Building CNN architectures with convolutional, pooling, and fully-connected layers
- Training neural networks using backpropagation and gradient descent
- Evaluating model performance on image classification tasks
